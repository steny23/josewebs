                        <p>
                            I am a student-athlete who has learned that growth happens far beyond the scoreboard. While competing at a high level, I've been blessed with opportunities to express my creativity and leadership through graphic design, videography, and athletic operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've created graphic artwork for school sponsors, produced the opening intro for my school's sports news station, and developed multiple videos shared across our athletic platforms. My work has been featured by the CIAA, HBCU Gameday, and the Florida Beach Bowl, and I've helped create commercials used to promote our athletics program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the creative side, I've been hands-on in running athletic events and open houses, gaining real experience behind the scenes. From my freshman through junior year, I completed three internships that helped shape my professional identity while balancing the demands of being a student-athlete.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I entered college without a clear vision of who I wanted to be. Through mentorship, hard lessons, and perseverance, I've grown into the man I strive to become—fair, just, and kind. My journey hasn't been easy, from walking on to earning a scholarship, working side jobs to afford school, and constantly adapting to new challenges. Every obstacle has helped shape my purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm grateful for every step of the journey and excited to see where this road called life takes me next.
                        </p>
